## [v4.0.2] - 2026-02-01
### Added
- **Emergency Liquidation**: Circuit breaker now triggers an immediate **Market Close** of all positions when `max_loss_usd` ($200) is breached. Matches empirical "Toxic Inventory" analysis findings.

## [v4.0.1] - 2026-01-30
### 🛡️ Circuit Breaker Optimization (Risk Management)
- **Parameters**: Lowered `max_loss_usd` from $350 to **$200** ("Golden Zone")
- **Analysis**: Conducted sensitivity scan on Oct 2025 crash data.
    - $200 limit prevents ~50% more losses compared to $350.
    - False positive rate increases slightly but prevents major blowups.
    - Documentation added: `docs/analysis_circuit_breaker_v4.md`

## [v4.0.0] - 2026-01-27
### MVP Release - ML Enhanced Strategy
- **New Feature**: Integrated LightGBM Volatility & Direction Models
  - Volatility Model: Predicts 15m range to adjust spread/size (Aggressive mode)
  - Direction Model: Predicts 15m trend to skew grid layers
- **Performance**: Validated improvement over baseline (Sharpe +61%, PnL +68%)
- **Dashboard**: Added "v4.0 ML Insights" section with real-time predictions
- **Strategy**: Added `ml/strategy_v4.py` and updated `market_maker.py` integration
